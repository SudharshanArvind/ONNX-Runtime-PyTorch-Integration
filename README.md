# ONNX-Runtime-PyTorch-Integration
This project demonstrates how to export a simple neural network from PyTorch to the ONNX format and perform efficient inference using ONNX Runtime. It helps developers understand model conversion, runtime execution, and basic performance benchmarking between PyTorch and ONNX.
